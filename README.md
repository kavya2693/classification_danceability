Classification of Danceability Report
=====================================

Overview
--------

This project focuses on the classification of danceability in music tracks, employing a dataset of 18,000 songs featuring attributes like tempo, energy, valence, loudness, speechiness, and acousticness. Utilizing Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery, and Google Cloud Storage, this study integrates cloud technologies for efficient data handling, analysis, and model training, demonstrating the cloud's pivotal role in managing and processing large datasets.

Technologies and Tools Used
---------------------------

-   Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Serves as the primary environment for project execution, offering robust infrastructure for data storage and analytics.
-   BigQuery: A powerful data warehouse tool used for storing, querying, and analyzing large datasets quickly and efficiently.
-   Google Cloud Storage: Provides a secure and scalable space for storing the dataset, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.
-   Python and SQL: Utilized for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training within the BigQuery environment.
-   Machine Learning: A logistic regression model was developed within BigQuery ML, aimed at predicting a track's danceability based on its features.

Data Collection and Preparation
-------------------------------

-   The dataset, containing various track features, was sourced and uploaded to Google Cloud Storage, followed by integration with BigQuery for in-depth analysis and model training.
-   Data integrity checks, type verification, and exploratory analysis, including statistical summaries and visualization (scatter plots, histograms), were conducted to understand data distribution and identify outliers.

Model Development and Evaluation
--------------------------------

-   A binary classification model (logistic regression) was trained to distinguish danceable tracks, employing features like tempo, energy, and loudness.
-   The model underwent rigorous evaluation using metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score, with a focus on understanding its predictive power and areas for improvement.

Business Insights and Applications
----------------------------------

-   The model's insights can significantly enhance user experiences on platforms like Spotify, enabling personalized playlist curation and targeted content recommendations.
-   Content creators on social media, especially Instagram, can leverage the danceability classification to create engaging content that resonates with the audience.
-   The analysis offers valuable insights for artists, record labels, and marketers, aiding in strategic decision-making related to music production and promotion.

Conclusion
----------

This project exemplifies the intersection of music, data science, and cloud technology, showcasing how machine learning can provide actionable insights in the entertainment industry. The model's ability to classify tracks based on danceability opens up new avenues for personalized music experiences, content creation, and targeted marketing strategies.
